This is a simple Node.js CRUD application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete users.

To run the application, first install the dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, start the server by running the following command:

```
npm run devStart
```

The application will be running on port 3000. You can test the application by sending the following requests:

* GET /users: This will return a list of all users.
* POST /users: This will create a new user.
* GET /users/:id: This will return the user with the specified ID.
* PUT /users/:id: This will update the user with the specified ID.
* DELETE /users/:id: This will delete the user with the specified ID.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The `models/user.js` file defines the user model. The model contains the following fields: name, email, and birth_date.
* The `routes/users.js` file defines the routes for the user resource. The routes include endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users.
* The `server.js` file defines the Express app and starts the server. The app uses the `mongoose` library to connect to the database and the `express.json()` middleware to parse JSON requests.
